Features
:  
- Dimming control over 4 power outlets (one per channel)
- 10A per-channel replaceable fuses (_yes, the image says 5A. I replaced them_).

{: .warning }
> Only useful for dimming incandescent lights.
>
> _Dimmers still allow some minor current flow in the channel off state, so LEDs or any other small loads will still behave as powered (called "ghosting")._

## Fuses

{: .warning }
> Due to electrical damage, many of the fuse sockets were replaced for internal ones <br>
> (see an example in [images](#images))
